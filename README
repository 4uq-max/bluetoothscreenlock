Simple python script to ping a bluetooth device and lock the screen using xscreensaver when 
the device is out of bluetooth range.

When the device returns it will 
1) Play the back.wav file using aslaplayer 
2) Resume monitoring for the device to leave again 
3) Re-lock the screen if it goes out of bluetooth range.

Requires the pybluez bluetooth library
Replace back.wav with any file you want it to play when you or your device returns.
